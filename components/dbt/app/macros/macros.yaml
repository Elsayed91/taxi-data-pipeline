  - name: generate_schema_name
    description: >
      Generates a schema name based on a provided custom schema name or a default schema.
      overrides the default generate_schema_name.
    arguments:
      - name: custom_schema_name
        type: string
        description: Custom schema name to use. If not provided, the default schema will be used.
      - name: node
        type: string
        description: Name of the node to which the schema name will be applied.
  - name: src
    description: >
      - Generates a reference to a source or model depending on the target and provided arguments.
      - If the target is 'test', the function will generate a reference to the test version of the
      model or source.
      - If the target is 'test' and the model starts with 'seed_', the model will reference the 
      seed as usual despite the target.
      - If the target is not 'test', the function will use the standard builtin ref/source.
    arguments:
      - name: func
        type: string
        description: Function to use. Can be either 'ref' or 'source'.
      - name: model_name
        type: string
        description: Name of the model. If model name starts with 'seed_', the `ref` function is used.
      - name: dataset_name
        type: string
        description: Name of the dataset. Optional if using 'ref' function or if `model_name` starts with 'seed_'. 
  - name: distances_from_airports
    description: >
      Generates four columns containing the distance between two points and three major airports in New York City (JFK, EWR, and LGA) using the longitude and latitude coordinates of the points.
    arguments:
      - name: lon1
        type: float
        description: Longitude coordinate of the first point.
      - name: lat1
        type: float
        description: Latitude coordinate of the first point.
      - name: lon2
        type: float
        description: Longitude coordinate of the second point.
      - name: lat2
        type: float
        description: Latitude coordinate of the second point.
  - name: extract_datetime_parts
    description: Extracts various date and time parts (day of month, month, year, day of week, hour of day) from a given timestamp column.
    arguments:
    - name: timestamp_column
      type: string
      description: >
        The name of the timestamp column to extract date and time parts from.
        outputs:
        - name: day_of_month
          type: integer
          description: The day of the month (1-31) from the given timestamp column.
        - name: month
          type: integer
          description: The month (1-12) from the given timestamp column.
        - name: year
          type: integer
          description: The year from the given timestamp column.
        - name: day_of_week
          type: integer
          description: The day of the week (0-6) from the given timestamp column, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.
        - name: hour_of_day
          type: integer
          description: The hour of the day (0-23) from the given timestamp column.
  - name: payment_form
    description: >
      returns the form of payment for payment_type.
    arguments:
      - name: payment_type
        type: int
        description: > 
          payment_type value. If none of the below, will return null.
          1= Credit card

  - name: refv2
    description: >
      Generates a reference to a model, depending on the context.
    arguments:  
    - name: model_name
      type: string
      description: >
        The name of the model.
        It provides seamless unit-testing capabilities by simply prefixing the model name with 'test_' 
        to reference the unit-test data sample if the target variable is 'test'. If the target variable
        is 'test' and the model is a seed, then nothing will happen, this is due to a naming convention
        where seeds always start with 'seed_'.
        if the target is not test, then it will provide the same functionality as builtin.ref.
        builtins.ref(model_name) should be a better choice however it returns an error 
        'str' object has no attribute 'database' with and without .include(database=false).
